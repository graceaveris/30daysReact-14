Day Fourteen // 30 days of React challenge // "Build your own Trump Quote" app

A react.js app that connects with https://whatdoestrumpthink.com/api-docs/index.html and allows you to build your own trump quote using other trump quotes.

Follow me programming noob as I stumble my way through self-learning React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned.

By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
